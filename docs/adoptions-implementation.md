# Adoptions Module Implementation

## Completed
- ✅ Created the domain models (Adoption, Status)
- ✅ Defined the interfaces (Repository, Service)
- ✅ Implemented the application service (AdoptionService)
- ✅ Implemented the PostgreSQL repository (PostgresRepository)
- ✅ Implemented the API handlers and router
- ✅ Added database migration script
- ✅ Updated main.go to connect to the database and set up the routes
- ✅ Added .env, .env.example, and Docker Compose configurations
- ✅ Enhanced the Makefile with development commands
- ✅ Updated README.md with project details

## TODO for Next Steps
- Implement integration tests for the adoptions module
- Add authentication middleware for protected routes
- Implement the remaining modules (users, pets, donations) following the same pattern
- Add validation for request payloads
- Set up continuous integration
- Implement frontend components for adoption management
- Add error handling middleware
- Set up logging for all requests
- Implement database migrations with a proper migration tool

## Adoption Workflow
1. User selects a pet and submits adoption request
2. Admin reviews the adoption request
3. Admin can update the status (approve, reject, request more documents)
4. User is notified of status changes
5. If approved, adoption is completed and pet status is updated
